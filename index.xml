Date Action 19 September Update on Online/Offline planning of BAPC2021 9 October BAPC preliminaries (organized by individual universities) 13 October First round of slot allocations 30 October BAPC 2021 This planning is subject to change as the Benelux still faces problems with COVID-19.</description></item><item><title>Registration</title><link>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/registration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 23:41:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/registration/</guid><description>Registration The registration will open after the preliminaries have taken place.
Preliminaries The slots per institution for BAPC21 are limited. As there tends to be more teams than slots available, your institution can hold preliminary contests to determine which teams qualify for BAPC21. The preliminaries will hold on Saturday, 9 October.
Registration for a preliminary at your institution is independent of a registration for BAPC21. Information on how to register a team representing your university is often arranged via your teaching staff or the study association representing either the mathematics or computer science department.</description></item><item><title>Contest</title><link>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/contest/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 23:41:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/contest/</guid><description>Contest Due to COVID-19 measures, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether we will be able to hold an on-site contest at the VU Amsterdam campus. We are working on both on-site and online contests and will inform you as soon as possible. Ideas have been pitched in April to the other institutions.</description></item><item><title>Rules</title><link>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/rules/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 23:41:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://studieverenigingstorm.github.io/BAPC21-site/rules/</guid><description>Rules These rules and the chosen format may change depending on the measures for the COVID-19 pandemic.
