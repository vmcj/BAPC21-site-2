## The Contest

### Introduction

- The language of the contest is English. All written contest materials will be in English.
- The contest lasts for 5 hours.
- From the beginning until one hour before the end of the BAPC, the scores are displayed.

### Problems

- At least six problems will be posed. The jury intends to develop problems with minimal dependence on detailed knowledge of a particular application area or a particular contest language.
- A contestant may submit a claim of ambiguity or error for a problem statement by submitting a clarification request to a judge. If the judges agree that an ambiguity or error exists, a clarification will be issued to all contestants.
- The jury has the right to change or withdraw problems during the contest before informing all teams.

### System

- A solution for a problem has to be written in C99, C++ (version 14 or later will be available), Python (versions 3 will be available), Java (version 11 or later) or Kotlin (version 1.3), unless the problem statement explicitly states otherwise. Business teams can request other submission languages, on which the organization will decide whether it will be made available for submission. *This is subject to change*
- A team is disqualified if they submit harmful code that disrupts the contest.
- A submission can use the standard library of the language.
- A list of usable libraries are provided by the organization before the contest.
- On-site contest
  - Each team will use at most one workstation.
  - There is an explicit restriction on internet access during the contest. Interaction about problems is allowed via clarification requests with the jury and internal discussion within the team. Asking questions about the contest to crew or coaches is subject to disqualification.
- Online contest
  - Each team will use at most three workstations (i.e. at most one computer per team member).
  - There is no explicit restriction on internet access during the contest. The organization discourages copying code from reference material, as solutions will be checked on similarities. If there is suspicion of plagiarism among teams, both teams are subject to disqualification.
  - Interaction about problems is allowed from clarification requests with the jury and internal discussion within the team. Posing questions to a third-party, such as Stack Overflow or another team, is prohibited. The same applies to general programming errors.

### Judgment

- Each run is judged as accepted or rejected by a judge, and the team is notified of the results.
- For each problem, the jury has a correct solution and test data.
- A problem is solved after acceptance by the judges. The judges are solely responsible for accepting or rejecting runs.
- The winner of the pool is decided by (in order):
  - The team with the most solved problems.
  - The team with the least total time. The total time is the sum of the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the accepted run, plus 20 penalty minutes for every rejected run for that problem regardless of the submission time. Time is not consumed when the problem is not solved.
  - The team that first submitted its last accepted problem is ranked higher. When a tie still remains, the team that first submitted its second-last accepted problem is ranked higher, and so on. When this does not resolve the tie, the ranks will be determined by chance.
- The problem set is the responsibility of the jury.
- The jury must be contacted through a "Clarification Request".
